    "# Text Summarizer\n",
    "\n",
    "Today researches are being done in the field of text analytics. And one such application of text analytics and NLP is a Feedback Summarizer which helps in summarizing and shortening the text in the user feedback. This can be done an algorithm to reduce bodies of text but keeping its original meaning, or giving a great insight into the original text. I will be using NLTK - the Natural Language Toolkit. which will serve my purpose right. Install NLTK module on your system using : sudo pip install nltk Let's understand the steps - Step 1: Importing required libraries There are two NLTK libraries that will be necessary for building an efficient feedback summarizer."
