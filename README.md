# ðŸ§  Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects

This repository contains multiple NLP projects implemented using **TensorFlow/Keras**, **PyTorch**, and classic ML techniques.  
The goal is to explore different tasks in Natural Language Processing, including classification, summarization, and transformers.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. Fake News Detection
- Detects whether a news article is **fake** or **real**.  
- Uses NLP preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, embeddings).  
- Implements deep learning models for classification.  

### 2. SMS Spam Detection
- Classifies SMS messages as **spam** or **ham**.  
- Uses word embeddings and sequential models (RNN/LSTM).  
- Evaluates accuracy and precision on benchmark SMS datasets.  

### 3. Text Classification
- General-purpose **text classification pipeline**.  
- Can be adapted to classify documents, tweets, or reviews.  
- Experiments with TF-IDF, embeddings, and neural models.  

### 4. Text Summarizer
- Implements **text summarization** (extractive and/or abstractive).  
- Uses NLP preprocessing and deep learning architectures.  
- Condenses long documents into concise summaries.  

### 5. Transformer Model from Scratch (TensorFlow)
- Educational project: builds a **Transformer model** (like in *Attention is All You Need*) **from scratch** in TensorFlow.  
- Covers **positional encoding, multi-head self-attention, encoder-decoder structure**.  
- Useful for understanding how modern LLMs (BERT, GPT) work at a fundamental level.
